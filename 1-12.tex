  Let $D = \{ w \mid w \text{contains an even number of \texttt{a}'s and
  \texttt{b}'s and does not contain the substring \texttt{ab}}\}$. Give a DFA with
  five states that that recognizes $D$ and a regular expression that generates $D$.
  (Suggestion: Describe $D$ more simply). \cite[p.~85]{Sipser}

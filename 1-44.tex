  The construction in \cite[Theorem~1.54]{Sipser} shows that every GNFA is equivalent to
  a GNFA with only two states. We can show that an opposite phenomenon occurs for DFAs.
  Prove that for every $k>1$, a language $A_k \subseteq \{\mathtt 0, \mathtt 1\}^*$ exists
  that is recognized by a DFA with k states, but not by one with $k-1$ states. \cite[p.~90]{Sipser}
